            <h3>My History With Poker</h3>

            <p>
                My first experience with poker was when I was much younger. My family would rent a beach house in Edisto Island, SC for a week
                each summer. During many of the nights there, my dad would often setup a game of poker with some of his friends who would come
                for the night and visit. Despite my being much younger (and I'm sure a pain!), he would always give me some of his change,
                and let me sit and play with them all. Typically the dealer would choose the game we played, so I got plenty of exposure to
                the various versions of poker, such as 5-card stud/draw, 7-card stud, and of course when I was dealer, 5-card draw with nearly
                everything wild (which I'm sure they weren't a fan of, lol). If of course got to keep all of the money I won, which I 'definitely'
                didn't spend entirely on candy or some other silly thing. ;)
            </p>

            <p>
                Occasionally, he would also let me come along with him to a game at a friend's house and we would do the same thing, various
                types of poker, dealer's choice. He and I would also play heads-up every once and a while, and he of course kicked my butt
                every time. For years, I never understood how he managed to always be so lucky that he could always win. Eventually however,
                I started learning different tricks, and between that and all the things he taught me, I actually became fairly good at the
                game.
            </p>

            <p>
                As I got older, and subsequently better at poker, I of course would regularly set up small games with friends to create
                opportunities to improve. Often, some of my friends had some experience with the game, which gave me a wonderful opportunity
                to improve my own skills or a chance to teach a friend a few new skills. This would continue regularly until I finally went
                into a casino for the first time.

            <h3>My First Time in a Casino</h3>

            <p>
                I will never forget my first time in a casino. I had been playing in small, local games off and on for years and had always
                wanted to go to one, but never got around to it. I forget exactly what prompted me to go on this particular night, but I convinced
                my significant other to let me use $100 of the spare money we had because I wanted to go give it a try (and if I lost, it
                wasn't money we needed, so it was okay). However, since it still wasn't "my" money, I of course felt incredibly guilty playing
                with it, which is usually a very bad idea.
            </p>

            <p>
                When I first walked in, the casino (which happened to be Casino del Sol, in Tucson, AZ) was extremely overwhelming (as most
                of them are). Sounds of slot machines everywhere, and this sort of "grand" look and feel to it as if it were made for
                royalty. I asked a security guard which way the poker room was and was directed to the left. As I walked around the corner,
                I was greeting by a ceiling painted and lit to look like the sky outside, which happened to (at the time) look identical
                to the faux "sky" ceiling. It felt so incredible and so much more than me, and to this day I still love looking at that
                ceiling and remembering how long it took me to decide if it was simply painted, or actually open to the sky.
            </p>

            <p>
                I finally found my way to the poker room. Having never been into a "casino" poker room, I of course had no idea what I
                was doing. I asked where to start, and what games were available, and was informed there was a seat open at a $1/$2
                no-limit hold'em table. This of course is exactly the kind of game I was hoping for, and immediately sat down.
            </p>

            <p>
                The other players were surprisingly friendly and kind. They explained to me about the free buffet to the players,
                as well as free sodas and the waitresses that you could order food from. They patiently explained some of the
                casino-specific rules such as once money passes the line, it's bet, and that you can't push "some" money out,
                and then state all in and put more in. In my nervousness, I made frequent mistakes such as folding when no
                bet had been made, or even folding as the big blind. They all of course very patiently laughed it off and it
                made for a great night.
            </p>

            <p>
                Eventually, my $100 had dwindled down to $6. I got lucky on that hand, and I think about 7 of the 9 players at
                the table stayed in, and I won with a slightly higher straight than the person to my right. Over the course
                of the next few hours, I think the overwhelming sensation and nervousness of it all wore off, and I started
                really playing poker. By the end of the night, after probably a total of about 6-7 hours of playing, I walked
                away with $101. I had made an "incredible" profit of $1 in my first night at a casino. I cashed out all of
                my money except for that $1 chip, which I kept and took home.
            </p>

            <p>
                I of course went back many times, usually making a profit (of much more than $1, lol). Eventually, I even
                considered making an attempt at a professional career in poker. Things didn't work out that way of course,
                but to this day I still have that $1 chip, which to me represents the same as the first dollar of profit a
                business makes and hangs on the wall.
