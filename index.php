        <h2>Learn How To Play Texas Hold'em</h2>

        <p>
            Welcome to my Texas Hold'em 101 tutorial page. On this page, you will find basic instructions on the game
            of Texas Hold'em, some "pro tips", as well as a little background on my personal history with the game.
            Eventually there will be a playable game interface which will allow you to learn the skills and offer
            advice and tips in real-time.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you're a beginner, I suggest reading through the basic rules of the game first. If you're an experienced
            player and just looking to see what this page is about, I recommend looking at the pro tips page, as well
            as revisiting us when we have a playable game version live to brush up on some of your skills.
        </p>

        <p>
            Please check back frequently to view new updates to both our tips as well as a live version of the game.
            For now, we hope you enjoy your experience on this page and that it helps teach you how to bring your
            "A" game during the next poker night!
